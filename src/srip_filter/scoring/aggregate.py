"""Stage 8 — aggregation and ranking (Phase 7).

Entirely **deterministic** — no LLM. Composes the additive ``final_score`` for gate-survivors
*only*, finalizes the three outcomes, and ranks the ``RANKED`` applicants with a deterministic
tiebreaker (PRD §10). The work is split by concern:

  * 7.1 pure score composition       — :func:`compose_final_score`, :func:`finalize_score`
  * 7.2 outcome finalize + ranking   — :func:`rank_records`

Hard invariants (PRD §0.3/§10.1/§12): ``final_score`` is the plain additive sum of the five §10.1
subscores, each ≥ 0 and **none subtracted** — so a missing optional signal (coursework / school /
resume = 0) is neutral and can never lower the total. Bonuses are computed before this stage and
can neither manufacture nor rescue a ``REJECTED`` outcome: only ``RANKED`` applicants are scored
and ranked at all. There is **no acceptance cutoff** here — the full ranked list is the deliverable
(§11).

No new config: the per-component caps already live in their own config sections, and the
composition is a pure sum of the existing :class:`Scores` subscores.
